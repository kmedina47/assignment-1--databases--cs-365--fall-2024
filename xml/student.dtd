  The student-information element is the root element of the student
  database and must contain one or more student elements. This is
  evident with the placement of the + metacharacter after (student).

  Note: This element does not allow for parsed character data nor simple
  character data.

  Note: The ? metacharacter associated with the 'middle-name' and
  'preferred-name' elements represents the optional characteristic of
  these particular elements.
